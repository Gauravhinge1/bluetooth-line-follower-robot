# ü§ñ Arduino Line Follower + Obstacle Avoider + Bluetooth-Controlled Robot  
### with Servo-mounted Ultrasonic Sensor for Smart Obstacle Detection

---

## üìã Project Overview

This robot is built using Arduino UNO and integrates multiple functionalities for intelligent navigation:  
- **Line Following:** Uses IR sensors to follow a black line track.  
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo scans left, center, and right to detect obstacles and choose the clearest path.  
- **Bluetooth Control:** HC-05 Bluetooth module allows manual control via smartphone commands.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Upload robot_control.ino to your Arduino UNO.  
2. Power the robot and make sure Bluetooth is paired.  
3. Start with manual control or autonomous mode (no Bluetooth input).  
4. Watch the robot follow lines and avoid obstacles using servo scanning.
